# Themes

Put themes into the `themes` directory. To select the used theme, symlink the file in that directory into `current-theme.rasi`. [Just like Kitty](.config/kitty/README.md).

## Palenight

For instance, to use the palenight theme do:

```sh
ln -s themes/palenight.conf current-theme.rasi
```
